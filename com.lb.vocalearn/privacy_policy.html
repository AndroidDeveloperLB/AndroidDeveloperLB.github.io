    <h1>Privacy Policy for <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lb.vocalearn" target="_blank">VocaLearn</a></h1>

    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> September 16, 2025</p>

    
    <h2>Privacy Policy Summary</h2>
    <p>This privacy policy explains how your data is handled when you use the app, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lb.vocalearn" target="_blank"><strong>VocaLearn</strong></a>. The app itself does not directly collect, store, or use any of your personal data. All data processing is done by third-party services from Google to provide features such as advertising (AdMob), anonymous usage statistics and crash reports (Firebase Analytics and Crashlytics), and app configuration (Firebase Remote Config).</p>
    <p>Since the app developer does not have access to any personal data, it is not possible to fulfill requests for data access or deletion. For any data-related concerns, you should contact the third-party providers directly.</p>
    
    
    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <h2>1. Third-Party Services Used</h2>

    <p>This App uses third-party services that may process personal data to provide their services. These companies are Data Processors on my behalf. I encourage you to review their privacy policies to understand their data practices.</p>

        <li><strong>Data Processed:</strong> AdMob processes data to show personalized and non-personalized ads. This may include your IP address, device identifier (such as the Android Advertising ID), and other information about your device and app usage.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal Basis:</strong> We rely on your consent to process this data for personalized advertising. You can manage your ad consent choices through the GDPR consent dialogue provided by the app.</li>
        <li><strong>Privacy Policy:</strong> You can review Google's privacy policy for AdMob at: <a href="https://www.google.com/adsense/localized-terms?hl=en_US" target="_blank">https://www.google.com/adsense/localized-terms?hl=en_US</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Firebase Analytics (Google LLC)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Purpose of Processing:</strong> To provide me with anonymous statistics about app usage, such as the number of active users, app installations, and which features are most popular.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Processed:</strong> Firebase Analytics automatically collects data such as device identifiers, app version, country, and information about user behavior within the app (e.g., screen views). This data is aggregated and does not identify you personally.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal Basis:</strong> This processing is based on my legitimate interest to understand and improve the App's performance and functionality.</li>
        <li><strong>Privacy Policy:</strong> You can review Google's privacy policy for Firebase at: <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank">https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Firebase Crashlytics (Google LLC)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Purpose of Processing:</strong> To monitor the App's stability and to identify and fix bugs and crashes.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Processed:</strong> Crashlytics collects crash reports, stack traces, device state information, and other technical details to help diagnose the cause of a crash. This data is not used for personal identification.</li>

    </ul>
    
    <h3>Firebase Remote Config (Google LLC)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Purpose of Processing:</strong> To allow me to dynamically change the App's behavior and appearance without requiring users to download an App update.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Processed:</strong> Remote Config processes anonymous data such as the App's country, language, version, and your device's Android Advertising ID to determine which configuration to deliver. This data is not personally identifiable.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal Basis:</strong> This processing is based on my legitimate interest to improve the user experience by delivering tailored content and features and to manage the App's settings dynamically.</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>2. User Rights and Data Removal</h2>

    <p>Because I, as the app developer, do not directly store or process any of your personal data, I have no way to identify you or to link your identity to any data collected by the third-party services (AdMob, Firebase Analytics, Crashlytics, Remote Config). Therefore, I am not able to fulfill requests for data access, rectification, or erasure from these services.</p>

    <p>These third-party services are responsible for their own data handling and offer their own mechanisms for data removal or consent management. For any data-related requests, you will need to contact the respective third-party provider directly as per their privacy policies.</p>

    <h2>3. International Data Transfers</h2>

    <p>The third-party services used by this App (Google LLC) are based in the United States. Your personal data may be transferred to and stored in the United States. These transfers are protected by legal safeguards such as Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), which Google has implemented to ensure an adequate level of data protection.</p>

    <h2>4. No EU Representative</h2>

    <p>As a solo developer with no establishment in the EU and with data processing that is not &ldquo;large-scale&rdquo; or &ldquo;regular and systematic monitoring of data subjects,&rdquo; I am not required to appoint an EU representative under GDPR Article 27. I am, however, committed to complying with all other aspects of GDPR.</p>

    

    <h2>6. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>

    <p>I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new policy on this page and updating the effective date.</p>
